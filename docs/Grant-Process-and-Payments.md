## Grant Phases & Associated Payments

<br/>

### A. Application Review Phase
> Before submitting an application read this document in its entirety, study grant applications with a similar mission in the [Stacks Grant Launchpad](https://github.com/stacksgov/Stacks-Grant-Launchpad/issues) repo, and build a relationship with the Stacks community by commenting on open and/or previous grant application on the Stacks Discord server.
  
The Application Phase consists of the following steps:

- Submit you application via the [Stacks Foundation Projects Launchpad](https://grants.stacks.org/). 
  > *NOTE: the Grant Launchpad creates a Github issue for your project application. After creating your application all interaction, revisions, updates occur on Github.*
- During the "Application On Deck" and "Application In Review" phases, you may receive informal feedback received from the community on your application via comments on your Github issue.
- If needed, revise your application based on the feedback you receive.
- Wait for the formal "Grant Review Committee" phase to conclude and receive your formal determination.  
  - Please note, applications can be denied at any point during the review process.  However, applications will only be approved at the conclusion of the "Grant Review Committee" phase.
> For additional details, see [Application Review Phase Schedule](application-review-phase-schedule)

<br/>

### B. Onboarding Phase
The Onboarding Phase consists of the following steps:
- After your grant is approved, you will be invited to a kickoff meeting.  After this meeting all applicants will begin the onboarding process, which involves submitting personal information for KYC and contract execution purposes.  
- Once your contract has been successfully executed your initial payment is disbursed and you are free to begin working on your project.
- The Onboarding Phase can take 1-3 weeks.

<br/>

### C. Milestone Phase
Depending on the size of your project budget you may either skip this step, or repeat it several times (see this [chart](#payment-quantity-milestone-quantity--payment-sizing) for details). Please review [Deliverable Delivery Guidelines](https://github.com/stacksgov/Stacks-Grant-Launchpad/wiki/Deliverable-Delivery-Guidelines) for additional details.

<br/>

### D. Final Deliverable Phase
The Final Deliverable Phase works just like a Milestone Phase. At the conclusion of this phase you will be awarded your final payment. Please review [Deliverable Delivery Guidelines](https://github.com/stacksgov/Stacks-Grant-Launchpad/wiki/Deliverable-Delivery-Guidelines) for additional details.
  
<br/>

## Application Review Phase Schedule
Applications are reviewed in **Cohorts**. Each Cohort consists of four **Sections**:
-   **A** : Applications Open
-   **B** : Applications Close
-   **C** : Grant Review Committee (2 weeks)
-   **D** : Final Decisions & Determinations Announced (1 week)
  
<br/>

Please note:
- During Section 'A' applications will be labeled as either 'On Deck' or 'In Review'.  See diagram below.
- Applications may be rejected during any Section of the Application Review Phase. 
- Applications will only be approved during the final Section of the Application Review Phase.
