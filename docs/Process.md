### Project Phases & Payment Schedule

#### A. Application Review Phase
The Application Review Phase consists of the following steps:
- Before submitting an application read this document in its entirety, study project applications with a similar mission in the Program Applications Github repo, and build a relationship with the Stacks community on the Stacks Discord server.
- Submit an application via the [Stacks Foundation Projects Launchpad](https://grants.stacks.org/). 
  - *The Project Launchpad creates a Github issue for your project application.*
  - *After creating your application all interaction, revisions, updates occur on Github.*
- Receive informal feedback received from the community on your application via comments on your Github issue.
- Revise your application based on the feedback you receive.
- Wait for the formal review and determinations for your funding round to be announced.
> For additional details, see [Application Review Phase Schedule](application-review-phase-schedule)
#### B. Onboarding Phase
The Onboarding Phase consists of the following steps:
- Project Lead verifies identity using a third-party KYC service.
- Project Lead (aka appicant) signs contract and a representative from the Stacks Foundation countersigns contract.
- Initial Payment disbursed at the conclusion of the Onboarding Phase.
- Begin work on your project.
- In total, this process will take 1-3 weeks.
#### C. Milestone Phase
Depending on the size of your project budget you may either skip this step, or repeat it several times (see this [chart] for details), but in general, a Milestone Phase consists of:
- Post a link to the completed work and request a review by commenting on your Github issue.  
- Allow the Stacks community an opportunity to review and comment on your work verifying it is done as outlined in the project application.  
- Once it is determined the work matches the approved project application your Milestone Payment will be disbursed. 
- In total, this process will take 1-3 weeks.
#### D. Final Deliverable Phase
The Final Deliverable Phase works just like a Milestone Phase. At the conclusion of this phase you will be awarded your final payment.

### Project Lead Responsiblities
---
When you submit an application, you are considered the applicant or Project Lead. Before you submit, its worth better understanding the responsiblities that come with that role:
- While a project may have several project team members, a project can only have one Project Lead. 
- The Project Lead will need to verify their identity (using a third party KYC service) and sign a contract.
- The Project Lead will need to provide tax documentation in the form of a completed 1099, and/or 8ben, fw8ben depending on their home domicile.
- The STX wallet address and memo the Project Lead provides in the original project application will be associated with the contract and cannot be changed. 
- Additionally, this address will be the sole wallet to receive funds for the project.
