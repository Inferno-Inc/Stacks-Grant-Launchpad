### Grant Phases & Associated Payments

<br/>

#### A. Application Review Phase
> Before submitting an application read this document in its entirety, study grant applications with a similar mission in the [Stacks Grant Launchpad](https://github.com/stacksgov/Stacks-Grant-Launchpad/issues) repo, and build a relationship with the Stacks community by commenting on open and/or previous grant application on the Stacks Discord server.
  
The Application Phase consists of the following steps:

- Submit you application via the [Stacks Foundation Projects Launchpad](https://grants.stacks.org/). 
  > *NOTE: the Grant Launchpad creates a Github issue for your project application. After creating your application all interaction, revisions, updates occur on Github.*
- During the "Application On Deck" and "Application In Review" phases, you may receive informal feedback received from the community on your application via comments on your Github issue.
- If needed, revise your application based on the feedback you receive.
- Wait for the formal "Grant Review Committee" phase to conclude and receive your formal determination.  
  - Please note, applications can be denied at any point during the review process.  However, applications will only be approved at the conclusion of the "Grant Review Committee" phase.
> For additional details, see [Application Review Phase Schedule](application-review-phase-schedule)

<br/>

#### B. Onboarding Phase
The Onboarding Phase consists of the following steps:
- After your grant is approved, you will be invited to a kickoff meeting.  After this meeting all applicants will begin the onboarding process, which involves submitting personal information for KYC and contract execution purposes.  
- Once your contract has been successfully executed your initial payment is disbursed and you are free to begin working on your project.
- The Onboarding Phase can take 1-3 weeks.

<br/>

#### C. Milestone Phase
Depending on the size of your project budget you may either skip this step, or repeat it several times (see this [chart] for details), but in general, a Milestone Phase consists of:
- Post a link to the completed work and request a review by commenting on your Github issue.  
- Allow the Stacks community an opportunity to review and comment on your work verifying it is done as outlined in the project application.  
- Once it is determined the work matches the approved project application your Milestone Payment will be disbursed. 
- In total, this process will take 1-3 weeks.

<br/>

#### D. Final Deliverable Phase
The Final Deliverable Phase works just like a Milestone Phase. At the conclusion of this phase you will be awarded your final payment.

-   **A** : Applications Open

- Applications will only be approved during the final Section of the Application Review Phase.
