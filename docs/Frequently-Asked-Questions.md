## General
---
</br>

### **Does a project need to be open-source to receive grant funding?**

Yes. All code produced as part of a grant must be open-source as explained in the [Grant Application Guidelines](https://github.com/stacksgov/Stacks-Grant-Launchpad/wiki/Grant-Aplication-Guidelines) section. It must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality.

> We prefer [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html), but [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html[), [MIT](https://mit-license.org/) or Unlicensed are also acceptable.

</br>

### **Is there a typical funding range for a certain level of grant type?**

Yes. Please refer to [Funding Stream Details](https://github.com/stacksgov/Stacks-Grant-Launchpad/wiki/Funding-Stream-Details) for information concerning the funding range for different grant tracks.

</br>

### **Can I list the Stacks Foundation as a partner?**

No. Grants are not considered partnerships, and although we will try our best to make sure that grantees are successful in completing their grants, we ask that you please don't advertise the Stacks Foundation as a partner.

</br>

### **Does the Stacks Foundation help with PR & Marketing of individual Grants?**

The Stacks Foundation does not offer individual marketing for teams. However, we do a monthly call to showcase grants in-progress and we highly recommend all grantees to participate. We may, at our discretion, also tweet about individual projects at milestone or final deliverable completion.

</br>

### **Can I reuse someone else’s Clarity Contract or any open-source code as a starting point?**

Yes. Clarity contracts are human readable by design. The Stacks community and the Grants Team promote the use of reusing contracts already deployed to the Stacks chain. When reviewing a grant application, we may ask you to revise your application if you are asking for funds towards the development of smart contracts that have already been deployed. Please search [source-of-clarity.com](https://source-of-clarity.com/) for any potential contracts you can use or build upon before scoping out the funding for your grant.

</br>

### **A grantee is using my code without respecting the terms of its license.**

Not cool. Please email the Grants Team with all relevant information at [grants@stacks.org](mailto:grants@stacks.org).

</br>

### **Does the Grants Team still host an office hours call?**

No, not at this time. We don't offer any office hours calls. We are using new channels for seeking help with community input. Please visit the [Discussion Section](https://github.com/stacksgov/Stacks-Grant-Launchpad/discussions) of the repository.

</br>

## Submitting A Grant
---
</br>

### **Can anyone apply?**

Yes, for the most part. To be awarded a grant, the applicant must be able to pass Know-Your-Customer onboarding in compliance with United States Law. To pass the onboarding, you must be able to supply and submit valid identification documents, proof of residence, and be over the age of 18. Any applicant that is a resident of a country listed on the [U.S. Department of Treasury Sanctions List](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information) is not eligible for a grant.

</br>

### **If I am currently enrolled in one of the other Stacks Programs can I still apply for a grant?**

If you are currently enrolled in - or - taking part in one of the other Stacks Launchpad Programs such as [Web3Starup Lab](https://www.web3startuplab.io/), [Stacks Accelerator](https://stacks.ac), [The Mintery](https://mintery.co/), you are not eligible to accept for a grant until you have finished the other program. However, you are able to apply for a grant while you are enrolled in another program so long as you intend to complete the program before the grant is approved.

</br>

### **Can I have more than one open grant?**

Individuals applying for a grant must **complete** the first grant before approval of the second solo grant applied for. However, you are able to apply for another grant while you have an open grant so long as you intend to complete the first grant before the second grant is approved.

</br>

### **If you prefer to remain anonymous are you still able to be awarded a grant?**

While all grantees must go through a Know-Your-Customer onboarding process on [Passbase](https://passbase.com/) to receive funding. This process is private between Stacks Foundation staff and You, the applicant.  You are also able to submit the name of a business entity rather than your personal name.

</br>

### **Can I submit a grant for an event sponsorship?**

We accept applications for putting on Stacks related events on a limited basis. Please apply for a Stacks Event Grant for consideration.

</br>

### **Can I submit a grant to fund my NFT project development?**

The Grants Program will not fund the development for the creative aspect, please apply to [the Mintery](https://mintery.co/) for developing your NFT. We will consider funding novel smart contracts for non-fungible tokens.

</br>

### **Can I subcontract portions of the work described in my application after the application has been accepted?**

Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by the Foundation, the grantee shall not subcontract, even partially, the development of the project/deliverable to any third party. If the project/deliverable is subcontracted to a third party without the consent of the Foundation, the Foundation is entitled to immediately terminate the Grant Agreement and to recover the grant amount already disbursed.  

</br>

## Review Process
---
</br>

### **How long does the grant review process usually take?**

Please refer to [Application Review Phase Schedule](./Process/#application-review-phase-schedule) for an up-to-date schedule of when application review will take place.

</br>

### **Is there a general set of review criteria?**

Please consult the [Project Application Expectations](./Project-Aplication-Guidelines/#project-application-expectations) section.

</br>

### **Why are other grant applications receiving feedback and/or approval before mine?**

Feedback and review are based on the grant track and amount requested. The application review process is irrespective of the order in which they were received.

</br>

### **My Application was rejected. Do you have any recommendations on where to go from here?**

All rejecections will include feedback from the Review Committee, if there are any follow-up questions please submit them to the [Discussion Section](https://github.com/stacksgov/Stacks-Grant-Launchpad/discussions).

### How do I join the application review committee?

Glad you asked!  Please email grants@stacks.org with the subjectline "Request to join Grant Review Committee".

### Who is on the application review committee?



</br>

## Funding & Payments
---
</br>

### **Can I get an upfront payment?**

Grantees receive an initial payment once approved and onboarding has finished. The initial payment is equal to a milestone payment. 

</br>

### **How is the value of STX tokens paid out in exchange for grant funding calculated?**

The price of STX tokens is calculated on a 7-day rolling average. Use the [STX Converter](https://grants.stacks.org/stacks-payment-converter) tool


</br>

### **Can I request payment in a token or fiat currency other than STX?**

Sorry, the Grants Program only funds grants in STX tokens.

</br>

### **Once I’ve finished onboarding, how long does it take to receive my first payment?**

All payments can take up to 20 days, from approval to corresponding payment.

</br>

### **How are STX tokens awarded as grant funds taxed?**

Please consult with your tax advisor. The Stacks Foundation reports all funds paid to grantees to the IRS in accordance with United States law.  Grantees are responsible for paying their own taxes and understanding regulator guidelines in their domicile.


</br>

### **Where can my STX funds be sent to?**

The STX funds can be sent to either a self-custodied wallet or to an exchange. <b>Please Note:</b> If you plan to send to an exchange, make sure you have included the memo that the exchange has provided to you. Any tokens sent to an exchange without a memo included on the application must inquire with the support team of the exchange for how to recover the funds. The Grants team cannot help recover the tokens.

</br>

### **Can I change wallet addresses after I have finished onboarding?**

Only in rare cases where the grantee has lost access to the address specified on their application, will we work with them to change the address we hold on file. Please reach out to the [Payments Team](mailto:payments@stacks.org) about changing your address prior to submitting your next milestone deliverable.

</br>

### **The address I listed on my application was wrong and I did not receive my funds, can the Grants Team recover the STX for me and/or replace it?**

Unfortunately, once the payment has been sent, there is nothing we can do, as the chain is immutable. It is the grantees' responsibility to make sure the address on the application and memo, if required, is correct before submitting their grant.

</br>

## Milestone Delivery
---
### **How do I submit a Milestone?**

The process for submitting a Milestone for review is explained on the [Process Page](Process#c-milestone-deliverable-phase)

### **Can I change the scope of my project after the application has been approved?**

Before revising the scope of your project or the requirements set out in the application, you must submit a request via the comment section below your application issue on GitHub. Any such changes will be subject to reevaluation by the committee under the same conditions as the initial application review process.

</br>

### **My next milestone/deliverables have changed, what should I do?**

Please comment on your project issue within the repo and explain the reasoning for pivoting. The Grants Team has the right to end the grant at this stage.

</br>

### **Can I submit a Grant for prior work?**

We do not approve grants for prior work. Applying for a grant to add new features will be considered as any other grant application.

</br>

### **My Grant has become stale. What does this mean?**

Grants become stale after 30 days without activity and are closed after 60 days of inactivity. 

</br>

### **I am unable to complete my grant, what are the steps for notifying the Grants team?**

Please comment on your project's issue explaining why this is the case.

</br>

### **Can I get help developing my grant from the Stacks Foundation team?**

We expect applicants to be well aware of the technical challenges required to develop and complete their grant when submitting their application. The Community and Foundations team members are available to help answer questions and set you up for success in order to complete your application. Please join the [Stacks Discord](https://discord.gg/5usXsXSUAK) for help.

</br>

## Completion & Beyond

### **Can I submit a follow up grant?**

Once your grant is complete, you are welcome to submit a follow-up grant application.

</br>

### **How long before I can apply for a new grant for a separate project?**

You may apply for a new grant for a separate project immediately upon completion of your last grant. If the follow-up grant is to continue building on the initial project, we usually like to see feedback from the community in your follow-up application.
