### Stacks Foundation Residence Program

The Residance program aims to create opportunities for leaders and teams to continue to build out the Stacks Ecosystem as subject matter experts. Our first cohort of residents is focused on key areas of the ecosystem, including governance, DAOs, token community management, NFTs, and Stacking. Below is an update from each resident and their respective projects.</br>[Learn More](https://stacks.org/introducing-stacks-residents).  We (the Stacks Foundation) treat the selection of Residents with the highest level of scrutiny and suggest applying for other grants prior to applying for a Residency. Residents are expected to produce code, tooling, resources, etc that enable to Stacks ecosystem to benefit from their contributions long after the conclusion of their Residency.
