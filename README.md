## Introduction

As part of our commitment to promoting a user-owned internet, The Stacks Open Internet Foundation (aka Stacks Foundation) provides support for developers, designers, community leaders, and more through various types of grants.  Grant Types are organized by Funding Streams.  Grant Types consist of milestone-driven grants, community-support grants, residencies for subject matter experts, and various other forms of support.  While grants funded through our programs are broad in scope, the core mission of the Stacks Foundation is to fund software development and research efforts related to [Stacks](https://stacks.co) and [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).  We prioritize funding strong **technical** projects that add _immediate and widespread value_ to the Stacks ecosystem. Anyone is welcome to submit a project application.

## Current Grant Priorities

Until the end of Q3 2023, the Stacks Foundation Grants Program will be prioritizing grants with the following areas of focus:
1. New and novel technologies that leverages the Stacks 2.1 upgrade (learn more [here](https://stacks.org/stacks-21-what-to-expect) and [here](https://stacks.org/21-stacking-improvements)).
2. New and novel technologies that strengthens the connection between Stacks and Bitcoin (learn more [here](https://stacks.org/stacks-21-what-to-expect)).
3. Technology and/or resources that attracts **developers** to and supports developers within the Stacks Ecosystem.
4. Technology and/or resources that attracts **founders** to and supports founders within the Stacks Ecosystem.

## Grant Review Committee

Each cohort of awarded grants is selected by the **Grant Review Committee** (GRC). The GRC meets for ~2 weeks each cohort immediately following the close of applications.  
- Prior to convening the GRC, the Stacks Foundation staff pre-reviews all applications and tiers them in terms of priority based on the [current grant priorities](#current-grant-priorities). 
- Low Priority and Medium Priority applications are typically by the Foundation staff so that the GRC only allocates time to High Priority and Highest Priority applications.
- GRC members are assigned 4-6 to the remaining applications each and review them over the course of ~2 weeks. The assessment the GRC review applications against can be found [here](#grant-review-assessment)
- At the conclusion of the GRC review period final determinations and made based on GRC feedback, Stacks Foundation OKRs, and available the available grant budget* for the cohort.

> *The grant budget for each cohort is 10% of the annual endownment of STX tokens in the Stacks Foundation treasury.

## Grant Review Assessment

The assessment consists of the following questions. Each question is scored from 1 to 4. 1 = Strongly Disagree and 4 = Strongly Agree. Typically, applications that are awarded grants have an average score of 3.5 of higher.  Each question is followed by a field for feedback on that item and the assessment also includes a field for general feedback near the end.  The assessment concludes with a simple two option question: **approve** or **deny**.
